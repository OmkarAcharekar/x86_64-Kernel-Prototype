# Build Setup Model to Compile a Kernel for `x86_64`

A compatible [[1]] binary (kernel) which refers to a specification [[1]] that defines the handoff from a bootloader to a payload. It has nothing to do with "multiple OS boot environments"! The binary gets packaged as an `ELF64-x86_64`-file [[2]], that can be loaded 
by `GRUB` [[0]], a`multiboot`-compliant bootloader. The demo project focuses on the **x86_64** processor architecture 
and `UEFI` as firmware environment.


## Build Process of the Kernel
The assembly code will do some minimal setup of the stack and other things, before it jumps into the code generated by the Rust compiler. It's the responsibility of 
the Rust code, to cope with the `multiboot2` payload (**multiboot information structure** (*mib*)) and all the system 
setup. The final binary gets completely assembled by `cargo`. We include [global assembly](https://phip1611.de/blog/include-assembler-source-files-in-rust-project-and-build-with-cargo/) 
(i.e., `*.S`-files next to the `*.rs`-files) and use a custom linker script (for `GNU ld`). Therefore, the setup
is similar to several `C`-projects, where also Assembly-Source and High Level-Source are compiled together in one build step.

There is no way this can be achieved without any assembly at all, because some low-level, architecture-specific 
preparation code is always required. At least one needs to configure the stack properly.

The figure below gives you a comprehensive overview over the assembling of the final artefact, an `ELF64-x86_64`-file.

## How To Run

When you test this project (`run_qemu.sh`), it will
1) start QEMU + loads `edk2/OVMF` [[3]] as `UEFI`-environment [[4]] 
2) `OVMF` will automatically boot `GRUB` (an EFI file)
3) the `GRUB`-EFI-file has a `grub.cfg` file and the Rust binary built-in into the `GRUB`-internal `(memdisk)`-filesystem.
4) `GRUB` loads the cfg-file which starts the binary with a Multiboot2 handoff


With a boot-order of `firmware > GRUB > %my-binary%`, the binary could take the role of:
* another bootloader (multistage boot)
* an OS-Kernel written in Rust 
* an OS-specific loader which prepares hand-off to an OS-kernel (to decouple large software into smaller blocks of responsibility)

### Software/Tool versions 
#### Required Packages & Tools
- `rustc` and `cargo` (e.g. via `rustup`)
- `gcc` for global assembly files
- `ovmf` (for testing in `QEMU` only)
#### Notes
- I tested the built on an Ubuntu 20.04 system with Linux 5.8.0
  - probably doesn't build on other operating systems than Linux (not tested)
- because of the file`rust-toolchain.toml` `cargo` will use the correct compiler
  version by default
- "run in QEMU"-demonstration tested with
  - **GRUB**: 2.04-1ubuntu26.1
  - **QEMU**: 4.2.1
  - `OVMF` files are searched in `/usr/share/OVMF`

## Trivia/FAQ/Good to know/What I've learnt
- Q: Are OPCODES between 32-bit and 64-bit code different?
    - A: yes, I ran into this and learned it the hard way. If you execute 64-bit code in a 32-bit environment
         or vice versa, strange things will happen.
- `multiboot(2)` only specifies behavior for `x86` but not for other architectures, like ARM
- Q: Why is the Rust binary a static library and not an executable?
    - A: The final binary gets assembled from multiple object files. Code must be relocatable by the linker,
         otherwise (relative) jumps and loads may get damaged.
