# Build Setup Model to Compile a Kernel for `x86_64`

A compatible  binary (kernel) which refers to a specification that defines the handoff from a bootloader to a payload. The `ELF64-x86_64`-file contains the binary   that can be loaded  by a GRUB bootloader. It fetches data from `UEFI` firmware and `cpuid` and logs that information to the screen. The main goals were to figure out how such a setup will look like

The demo project focuses on the **x86_64** processor architecture  and `UEFI` as firmware environment.

## Build Process of the Kernel
The assembly code of `ELF64-x86_64`-file will do some setup of the stack and other things, before it jumps into the code generated by the Rust compiler. `cargo` assembles The final binary. Also include global assembly and uses a custom linker script.


### Software/Tool versions
